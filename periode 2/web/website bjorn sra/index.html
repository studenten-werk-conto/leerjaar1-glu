            <p> Stroustrup is best known for his work on C++.
                In 1979, he began developing C++ (initially called "C with Classes").<br>
                In his own words, he "invented C++, wrote its early definitions, and produced
                its first implementation [...] <br>chose and formulated the design criteria for C++, designed all
                its
                major facilities, and was responsible for the processing of extension proposals in the C++ standards
                committee."<br> C++ was made generally available in 1985.
                For non-commercial use, the source code of the compiler and the foundation libraries was the cost of
                shipping (US$75);
                this was before everyone had Internet access.<br> Stroustrup also published a textbook for the
                language in
                1985,
                The C++ Programming Language.

                The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more
                difficult
                as
                it continues.
                The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start.<br>
                The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal.<br>
                [owo bot is dead] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound.<br>
                [owo bot is dead] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible.<br>
                The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over.<br>
                The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.<br>
                Союз нерушимый республик свободных<br>
                Сплотила навеки Великая Русь.<br>
                Да здравствует созданный волей народов<br>
                Единый, могучий Советский Союз!<br>

                Дружбы, народов надежный оплот!<br>
                Знамя советское, знамя народное<br>
                Пусть от победы, к победе ведет!<br>

                Сквозь грозы сияло нам солнце свободы,<br>

                Нас вырастил Сталин - на верность народу<br>
                На труд и на подвиги нас вдохновил.<br>
